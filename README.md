## Description

This program was used to figure out the annual salaries of 9 people.

### Notes

This will be any notes I add for you

## Outside Resources Used

I just followed what the teacher did (i.e. no other resources were used)

## Known Problems, Issues, And/Or Errors in the Program

There was a bug where I couldn't calculate the yearly salary because the array kept reaching null values (and hence didn't know what to do with them).  This bug has now been fixed.
